Automatic research for Microsoft Edge to get points for rewards

Microsoft created a rewards system to encourage people to use Bing and Microsoft Edge
By doing research, you earn points
After a certain number of points you earn rewards

Obviously, I don't use microsoft edge
So I created a program that automatically searches on bing with Microsoft Edge

Before using this program type the following command in your terminal : pip install Selenium
The program connects you to your microsoft account (you have to write your email adress and passworld in the code) and does research

Thank you for use my programm.
